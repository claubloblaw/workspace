# HEARTBEAT.md

# Keep this file empty (or with only comments) to skip heartbeat API calls.
# Add tasks below when you want the agent to check something periodically.

## Memory Maintenance (every 3-4 days)
- Check memory/daily/ for unprocessed files (files newer than last reduce)
- Run reduce: extract significant insights into memory/notes/ atomic notes
- Run reflect: update MOCs with new links, find cross-connections
- Check memory/ops/observations/ — promote any with actionable patterns
- Check memory/ops/tensions/ — resolve any that have new info
- Track last reduce date in memory/ops/last-reduce.md
