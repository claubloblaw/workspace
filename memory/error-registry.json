      "description": "OpenClaw's isValidMedia() in /opt/homebrew/lib/node_modules/openclaw/dist/media/parse.js only accepts ./relative paths and https:// URLs. TTS tool generates files at absolute paths like /var/folders/1k/.../voice-*.opus, which get rejected — MEDIA: line passes through as plain text instead of being parsed as media.",

      "workaround": "Use `message` tool with `filePath` + `asVoice: true` instead of inline MEDIA: directive. Bypasses the media parser entirely.",

      "prevention": "Patch will be overwritten on `openclaw update`. Should file upstream bug. After any update, verify TTS still works or re-apply patch.",
