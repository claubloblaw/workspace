# Nightshift — Codebase Maintenance via Leftover Claude/Codex Quota

- **Repo:** https://github.com/marcus/nightshift
- **Docs:** https://nightshift.haplab.com
- **Install:** `brew install marcus/tap/nightshift`
- **What:** Daemon that runs overnight, burns unused Claude Max / Codex subscription quota on codebase maintenance (dead code, doc drift, test gaps, security, lint fixes, etc.)
- **How:** Everything lands as PRs — merge or close. Budget-aware (default 75% cap). Supports both Claude Code and Codex CLIs.
- **Status:** Noted 2026-02-16. Not installed yet — no repo complex enough to justify it currently. Revisit when a meatier side project exists.
- **Marcel's plan:** 5x Claude Max subscriber. Will set up when there's a worthwhile codebase.
