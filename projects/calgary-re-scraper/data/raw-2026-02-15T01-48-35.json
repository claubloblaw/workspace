      "PublicRemarks": "Do not miss this fantastic prospect in Calgary’s deep SE community of New Brighton. A move-in ready gem - two-storey, 2,100 sq. ft. of living space with 3 bedrooms, 3.5 baths, a front-facing, double, attached garage and tons of parking room for the family fleet. Lots of curb appeal because of the tasteful, well-maintained front and back lawns and mature bushes. The main level is open concept highlighting 9-foot ceilings and warm hardwood floors throughout. Massive windows flood the whole area in warm natural light. The living room is made even more inviting with a tiled gas fireplace. Patio doors in the dining room provide access to the deck and backyard. Sleek, modern, dark brown cabinets are featured in the kitchen along with stainless appliances, a corner pantry, granite countertops, tiled backsplash and a breakfast bar/island with deep under counter mounted double sinks. The main level is completed with a 2-pc. bath adjacent to a convenient laundry room. Up to the carpeted second floor, the primary bedroom is its own sanctuary with a 3-pc. walk through ensuite and substantial walk-in closet. Two additional bedrooms share a tiled 4-pc. bath. The finishing touch is a bonus, well-windowed room which could be utilized as a family room or home office. The lower carpeted level is fully developed with a rec room for family enjoyment, a 4-pc. bath and a utility/storage room. A gigantic south-west facing backyard is fully fenced to give you your own private outdoor retreat. A railed wooden deck allows you to expand your summer entertainment area. The yard would be a delight for gardeners and hobbyists with a green thumb. Location here is key with quick access to Deerfoot and Stoney Trails, 52nd Street SE and a Walmart Supercentre, additional shopping and restaurants on 130th Avenue SE, schools (public and Catholic), child care, playgrounds, transit, New Brighton Resident Association, New Brighton Central Park and the South Campus Health Centre.  Don’t let this opportunit y pass you by. (31646443)",

      "PublicRemarks": "This upgraded and move-in-ready bungalow offers a rare combination of privacy and unbeatable walkability in the heart of Elboya. Situated directly across from the open green space of the St. Anthony school field, you’ll enjoy expansive views and no neighbours directly in front. The main floor is bright and inviting, featuring large living room windows that frame the park views. While maintaining a traditional layout, the dining room is perfectly situated beside the kitchen for easy entertaining and day-to-day flow. The main floor is highlighted by a large primary suite featuring extensive wall-to-wall built-in closets. Two additional good-sized bedrooms offer the perfect setup for children’s rooms or dedicated home offices. A renovated 3-piece bath completes the main level. The fully finished basement has been updated to include a modern laundry room, a spacious family room, an additional renovated full bathroom, and two large bedrooms. With a separate entrance and laundry situated outside the living area, the basement is well-configured for a potential legal suite (subject to City of Calgary discretionary approval and permitting). The private, south-facing backyard is designed for both relaxation and entertaining. A large tiered deck provides a perfect space for outdoor lounging and dining amidst perennial beds and a raspberry patch. A double detached heated garage provides comfort year-round, and a large gravel parking pad beside the garage accommodates two additional vehicles.  Perfect for extra cars, a boat, or a small utility trailer.  Experience the rare luxury of park-front peace and Britannia’s best amenities just steps from your front door. (31646226)",

      "PublicRemarks": "Welcome to the Engler, an architectural two-storey that pairs standout design with day-to-day function, set in a prime front-facing position on Hearth Green. With the park right out front, you’ll love having a natural gathering place for kids to run, neighbours to connect, or a quiet evening by the community firepit. Inside, the home makes an immediate impression with an open-concept plan filled with natural light, soaring two-storey windows, and a dramatic floating staircase with open black railing that keeps sightlines wide and the vibe airy. The kitchen is the true centrepiece, equal parts beautiful and practical, finished with two-tone cabinetry (white uppers raised to the ceiling and rich wood-grain lowers), crisp white quartz countertops, a white Silgranite sink, sleek black hardware, and a bold black backsplash that brings the whole look together. Cooking is a treat with a gas range plus built-in oven and microwave, while the open shelving beside the hood fan adds the perfect modern touch for styling and everyday convenience. Entertaining is effortless thanks to the full butler’s bar, complete with a sink and space for an additional fridge or freezer, ideal for hosting, family movie nights, or keeping things organized when life gets busy. The dining area is bright and welcoming with a statement light fixture and sun pouring in throughout the day, flowing seamlessly into the open-to-above living room where a modern black tile fireplace surround mirrors the kitchen finishes for a cohesive, designer feel. At the back of the home, thoughtful locker-style built-ins and generous mudroom storage keep backpacks, boots, and winter gear neatly tucked away, because real life happens here, and this home is built for it. Upstairs, the winged bedroom layout creates privacy and smart separation: the vaulted owner’s suite overlooks the backyard, while the secondary bedrooms are positioned at the front of the home. You’ll appreciate the balance of comfort and function with a  spa-inspired ensuite, a spacious five-piece main bath for the kids, and a large upper laundry room that makes the daily routine smoother. The open-to-below upper hallway adds a loft-like feel and reinforces the bright, expansive atmosphere created by the home’s abundant windows. Downstairs, 9’ foundation walls offer excellent future development potential and a more open, comfortable basement feel. Outside, step onto your deck right off the patio doors, perfect for summer BBQs and morning coffee, plus enjoy the convenience of an attached double garage. Set in Alpine Park, this home is surrounded by a community built around connection: parks, pathways, and a future village centre with local shops and cafés on the way. With design inspired by Calgary’s mountain, prairie, and urban influences, Alpine Park is crafted to encourage neighbourliness, and the Engler is a perfect match for that lifestyle. (31639169)",

      "PublicRemarks": "If you’ve been looking for easy, walkable living in the heart of  Garrison Woods, this main floor one-bedroom at Gateway Garrison Woods might be exactly what you had in mind. You’re just steps from everything in Marda Loop—coffee shops, restaurants, fitness studios, boutiques—and yes, Safeway is only a short stroll away, making last-minute grocery and morning coffee runs incredibly convenient. Inside, the layout just makes sense. Every inch of space is thoughtfully used, so nothing feels wasted. The open-concept kitchen features newer appliances and a breakfast bar that’s perfect for casual dinners or having friends over. The den is a standout feature, complete with custom built-ins for storage plus a wine and beverage fridge—ideal for working from home or creating a stylish extension of your living space. The living and dining area is bright and spacious, with direct access to your private patio and gate, giving you that easy in-and-out access that only a main floor unit can offer. The primary bedroom is generously sized and sits right next to the four-piece bathroom, and of course, there’s the everyday bonus of in-suite laundry. Beyond your front door, you’re close to the river pathways, the sandy shoreline at Sandy Beach Park, and the popular off-leash area at Altadore Off Leash Dog Park. You’re also just minutes from Mount Royal University, The scenic pathways in North Glenmore Park,  downtown, and transit routes. It’s the kind of location that makes day-to-day life feel effortless—whether you’re heading out for a walk, meeting friends in the Loop, or grabbing groceries on the way home. Included in the price of this home is a titled, heated underground parking stall. Another great benefit is the affordable condo fees which include heat, water, sewer and electricity. (31648019)",
