      "PublicRemarks": "A thoughtfully, well-designed two-storey home with numerous improvements and upgrades is now available in the very desirable SE community of Bonavista Downs. This is a unique home in that it features two garages. The first is a front-facing, single (21’x12’), attached, insulated and heated garage with upgraded wiring, and finished interior which includes shelving. The front rubber-paved driveway offers additional parking. The second is an oversized double (25’ x 28’), heated, detached garage accessed from the paved alley, and has a finished interior which includes shelving, cabinets, and a workbench and is wired for 220 volts. Three bedrooms, 3.5 baths and 2,250 sq. ft. of living space on three levels. Upon entering the tiled foyer, the natural light flowing in from the upgraded triple pane windows on all sides is remarkable.  Motorized window blinds allow you to control the light factor. The main floor is comprised of living room, dining room and kitchen and has warm hard wood floors throughout. To the left is the living room with woodburning, stone surround fireplace and enough space to experiment with various furniture configurations. The rear deck is accessed via French doors in the living room. To the right of the foyer is the dining room with ample room for entertainment and is adjacent to the kitchen. Cream cabinetry and plenty of it in the kitchen is a beautiful contrast to the dark granite countertops and tiled backsplash. Gleaming stainless appliances and a pantry add to the efficiency. A 2-pc. bath completes the main level. Moving upstairs, there is a combination of hardwood and laminate flooring. The primary bedroom is large and sunny with the benefit of a newly added walk-through closet and 4-pc. ensuite (double vanity). Two additional bedrooms, both with generous-sized closets, share a 4-pc. bath. The basement has been attractively finished and features a large, carpeted rec room with a second woodburning fireplace (both fireplaces passed WETT inspecti on in 2023). Across from the rec room is a tiled home office and tucked back of that is the laundry room with upgraded plumbing, venting and wiring; storage area and an upgraded 3-pc. bath. The house, attached garage and detached garage all have well-insulated (R40) attics. In 2023 the furnace was upgraded to a high-efficiency model with smart thermostat, a tankless water heater was installed and the humidifier was replaced. Both front and back yards are landscaped with lawn and mature trees. The back yard is fenced and has sprinklers installed. A bonus is your own hot tub. Well situated and close to Stoney, Deerfoot and Macleod Trails and Anderson Road. Proximity to shops and restaurants on both Macleod Trail and 130th Avenue; the Bow River; numerous schools (public and Catholic); churches; playgrounds; dog parks; Fish Creek Provincial Park and South Health Campus. This home has obviously been well tended as evidenced by the many upgrades and enhancements. Don't miss out on this outstanding opportunity. (31571312)",

      "PublicRemarks": "Welcome to this beautiful, newly renovated 4-bedroom, 3.5-bath bungalow in the heart of Canyon Meadows, where timeless design meets modern luxury. Every inch of this home has been thoughtfully updated inside and out—including the wiring, plumbing, hvac, and the beautiful, low-maintenance landscaping—creating a move-in-ready retreat on a quiet cul-de-sac in one of southwest Calgary’s most established communities. Step inside and immediately feel at home in the bright, open-concept main living area. The foyer features a built-in bench and stylish tile flooring, setting a welcoming tone that flows into the spacious living room, complete with a sleek gas fireplace and rich hardwood flooring throughout the main level. The kitchen is a showstopper, designed for both function and style with an abundance of cabinetry, quartz countertops, wall oven, and a massive central island with a cooktop and separate prep/veggie sink—perfect for entertaining or everyday family life. Two bedrooms on the main level include a luxurious primary suite, featuring a spa-inspired ensuite with a freestanding soaker tub, walk-in shower with rainhead, and custom walk-in closet with built-ins. The second bedroom includes a built-in armoire, making it ideal as a guest room or home office. A main-floor laundry room adds everyday convenience. The fully finished basement expands your living space with a huge open recreation area, a wet bar, and two additional large bedrooms, each with custom closets. This level also features two bathrooms—a convenient 2-piece powder room and a 3-piece bath with a walk-in shower—making it perfect for family and guests alike. Outside, the attention to detail continues. The yard is fully landscaped with easy-care design, built-in planters, and a large deck for outdoor dining and relaxation. The oversized double detached garage provides plenty of room for vehicles, storage, or a workshop, while the shared extra-long driveway offers additional parking space. Canyon Meadows  is a sought-after community known for its mature trees, beautiful mountain views, and strong sense of community. You’re close to Canyon Meadows Golf and Country Club, Fish Creek Park, and a wide range of schools, shops, and amenities. With quick access to major routes and public transit, it’s easy to get wherever you need to go—while still enjoying the peaceful charm of this established southwest neighbourhood. Elegant, functional, and move-in ready—this home perfectly combines modern comfort with the warmth of a mature Calgary community. (31533232)",
