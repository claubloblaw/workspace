Impervious surfaces are defined as any material which will seal the soil surface, impede water infiltration, collect solar heat or deprive tree or vegetation roots of aeration. Impervious surfaces effect many aspects of our city, including storm runoff volumes, pollutant concentrations and drainage. The city must understand and manage the number of impervious surfaces carefully to ensure the ongoing health and vitality of the municipality and the environment.

    "description": "The Impervious Surface 2023 dataset is a collection of polygon features derived from Calgary Digital Aerial Survey mapping linework which have been determined as impervious. Impervious surfaces are defined as any material which will seal the soil surface, impede water infiltration, collect solar heat or deprive tree or vegetation roots of aeration. Impervious surfaces effect many aspects of our city, including storm runoff volumes, pollutant concentrations and drainage. The city must understand and manage the number of impervious surfaces carefully to ensure the ongoing health and vitality of the municipality and the environment.

This tool measures equity at the local or neighborhood level, drawing from research on the Social Determinants of Health. The <A HREF=\"https://www.who.int/health-topics/social-determinants-of-health#tab=tab_1\" TARGET=\"_blank\"><B>Social Determinants of Health</B></A> refer to the social and economic factors that shape people\u2019s health and well-being. The Calgary Equity Index applies these same factors to assess how equity is distributed across Calgary, highlighting the systemic barriers that influence health outcomes and overall quality of life.\n\nThe CEI, updated in 2024, consolidates large amounts of data into a single, overall metric\u2014the total equity score\u2014and six key domains.  It uses data from 61 indicators, and each of these indicators helps to understand the diverse social conditions of people living in different parts of Calgary. Most of the indicator data comes from the 2021 Federal Census, while others come from administrative data within the City of Calgary and external propriety data.\n\nThe CEI is visualized on a map, showing the total equity score, individual domain scores, and indicator values for each of Calgary\u2019s 288 census tracts. A higher total equity score reflects greater inequities and needs, and more barriers to equity.\n\n<B>It is important to note that due to changes in the level of geography, additional indicator data, and the way the total equity score is reported, the results from the 2024 CEI are not directly comparable to the results from the 2022 CEI.\n\nTo learn more about the tool, please visit <A HREF=\"https://www.calgary.ca/research/calgary-equity-index.html?redirect=/calgaryequityindex\" TARGET=\"_blank\">www.calgary.ca/CalgaryEquityIndex</A>\n\nFor questions, please contact <A HREF=\"mailto:socialresearch@calgary.ca\">socialresearch@calgary.ca</A></B>",

Population in private households includes Canadian citizens and landed immigrants whose usual place of residence is Canada. Also includes refugee claimants, holders of work and study permits, Canadian citizens and landed immigrants at sea or in port aboard merchant or government vessels, and Canadian citizens away from Canada on military or diplomatic business. Excludes government representatives and military members of other countries and residents of other countries visiting Canada.\n\nAge refers to the age of a person (or subject) of interest at last birthday (or relative to a specified, well\u2011defined reference date).\n\nGender refers to an individual's personal and social identity as a man, woman, or non\u2011binary person (a person who is not exclusively a man or a woman). A person's gender may differ from their sex at birth, and from what is indicated on their current identification or legal documents such as their birth certificate, passport, or driver's licence. A person's gender may change over time. Statistics Canada collected data about transgender and non-binary populations for the first time on the 2021 Census. The category \"Men+\" includes men (and/or boys), as well as some non-binary persons. The category \"Women+\" also includes women (and/or girls), as well as some non-binary persons.\n\nThis is a one-time load of Statistics Canada federal census data from 2021 applied to the Communities, Wards, and City geographical boundaries current as of 2022 (so they will likely not match the current year's boundaries).

    "description": "The Employment data from the 2021 Federal Census covers labour force status, employment status, labour force participation rate, industry, and occupation. For questions, please contact socialresearch@calgary.ca. Please visit <a href=\"https://www.calgary.ca/research/population-profile.html\">Data about Calgary's population</a> for more information.\n\nLabour force status refers to whether a person was employed, unemployed or not in the labour force during the reference period. Not in the labour force refers to persons who were neither employed nor unemployed during the reference period. This includes persons who, during the reference period were either unable to work or unavailable for work. It also includes persons who were without work and who had neither actively looked for work in the past four weeks nor had a job to start within four weeks of the reference period.\n\nEmployment status refers to the employment status of a person during the period of Sunday, May 2 to Saturday, May 8, 2021. An employed person is one who did any work at all at a job or business, that is, paid work in the context of an employer-employee relationship, or self-employment. This category excludes persons not at work because they were on layoff or between casual jobs, and those who did not then have a job (even if they had a job to start at a future date). While an unemployed person is one who was without paid work or without self-employment work and was available for work. An unemployed person either: had actively looked for paid work in the past four weeks; was on temporary lay-off and expected to return to his or her job; or had definite arrangements to start a new job in four weeks or less.\n\nLabour force participation rate refers to the total labour force in that group, expressed as a percentage of the total population in that group.\n\nIndustry refers to the general nature of the business carried out in the establishment where the person worked. The industry data are produced according to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).\n\nOccupation refers to the kind of work performed in a job, a job being all the tasks carried out by a particular worker to complete their duties. An occupation is a set of jobs that are sufficiently similar in work performed. The occupation data are produced according to the National Occupational Classification (NOC) 2021.\n\nThis is a one-time load of Statistics Canada federal census data from 2021 applied to the Communities, Wards, and City geographical boundaries current as of 2022 (so they will likely not match the current year's boundaries). Update frequency is every 5 years. Data Steward: Business Unit Community Strategies (Demographics and Evaluation). This dataset is for general public and internal City business groups.",

    "description": "Aerial Imagery of the 2013 Flood Event in Calgary. From June 19-22, over 250 mm of rainfall and mountain snowmelt caused river levels to rise quickly, causing widespread flooding in southern Alberta. Peak river flow rates were 8x to 12x normal. This was Calgary\u2019s largest flood since 1897. \nThe Calgary flood 2013 orthophoto was created from aerial photography flown Saturday June 22, 2013 from 8:00 AM to 9:30 AM MDT.\nThe entire zipped up MrSID download file is 4.25 GB. Alternately, this file has been broken up into smaller townships files.

    "description": "Every year in May, The City conducts the Central Business District (CBD) cordon count. The cordon count is performed at ~ 30 locations around the CBD over a four week time period, collecting data on how people travel into and out of downtown Calgary. The CBD cordon circles the downtown with the Bow River to the north and the railway tracks to the south and from 11 Street in the west to the Elbow River in the east. These data represent the total number of persons entering (inbound) and exiting (outbound) at each location, by modes, during a 16 hour time period. This raw dataset is NOT normalized to average weekday. It is a snapshot of the inbound and outbound activity on a single day at these locations and reflects conditions specific to that day such as construction, lane closures, weather, etc. Therefore, data may not be directly comparable between locations or years.\n*Attachment is a summary of the inbound and outbound totals and mode of travel.* For additional information on cordon counts, see <a href=\"https://www.calgary.ca/planning/transportation/central-business-district-corridor-count.html\">Central Business District Cordon Count</a>.",

    "description": "Every year in May, The City conducts the Central Business District (CBD) cordon count. The cordon count is performed at ~ 30 locations around the CBD over a four week time period, collecting data on how people travel into and out of downtown Calgary. The CBD cordon circles the downtown with the Bow River to the north and the railway tracks to the south and from 11 Street in the west to the Elbow River in the east. These data represent the total number of persons entering (inbound) and exiting (outbound) at each location, by modes, during a 16 hour time period. This raw dataset is NOT normalized to average weekday. It is a snapshot of the inbound and outbound activity on a single day at these locations and reflects conditions specific to that day such as construction, lane closures, weather, etc. Therefore, data may not be directly comparable between locations or years.\n*Attachment is a summary of the inbound and outbound totals and mode of travel.* For additional information on cordon counts, see <a href=\"https://www.calgary.ca/planning/transportation/central-business-district-corridor-count.html\">Central Business District Cordon Count</a>.",

    "description": "This dataset is compiled from The City of Calgary\u2019s in situ (in location) water quality monitoring program. In situ field measurements are acquired from the deployment of multi-parameter sondes in surface waters by The City of Calgary. Measurements are collected using two methods: Continuous and Discrete.\nContinuous: In situ measurements logged at regular intervals (e.g. 15 minutes) for an extended period of time.\nDiscrete: Individual in situ measurements manually collected by a field technician.\nParameters that are measured include, but are not limited to: dissolved oxygen, water temperature, pH, turbidity, and specific conductance. Monitoring locations, intervals, and water quality parameters vary per site and period, depending on the monitoring objectives at the time of deployment. Multi-parameter sondes are routinely calibrated as per manufacturer\u2019s specifications and verified against independent standards.\n\nThis data is not a live data feed. It is manually retrieved, reviewed, and posted at regular intervals. Field data is not altered or adjusted, though any data that is determined to be invalid based on sensor interference, sensor failure, or damage, has been removed from the final dataset.\n\nMonitoring records are reported in the local time zone at the time of measurement for Calgary, Alberta (MDT/MST).",

The survey is conducted on an annual basis.\nThe data are weighted to ensure the overall sample\u2019s quadrant, ward, and age/gender composition reflects that of the actual Calgary population aged 18 or older according to Municipal and Federal Census data. Weights are included in the dataset.\n\nPlease use caution, when comparing data sets from previous years and consult the reports for any notable changes to the survey that may impact historical tracking. Further, if merging this data with historical data sets, please ensure that Qlabel and Valuelabel fields align. Given changes to the survey over time, variable and value fields may be inconsistent.\n\nPlease be advised that this survey, referenced as \"Fall Survey of Calgarians (2022)\", was previously known as \"Citizen Satisfaction Survey\".

    "description": "(Note: Updated inundation maps for 1:2 to 1:1000 floods are available from Alberta Environment and Parks (2020). The new draft maps can be viewed here: https://floods.alberta.ca/?app_code=FI&mapType=Draft)\nThese inundation maps show whether a property is at risk for various sized river floods. The size of flood shown on this map has a 1/2 or a 50% chance of occurring in any year.\nThe three distinct types of inundation shown on the maps are:\no Inundation - Area flooded overland due to riverbank overtopping.\no Isolated - Low lying areas that will not be wet from riverbank overtopping, but may experience groundwater seepage or stormwater backup.\no Protected - Area protected by a permanent flood barrier.\nThe flood areas shown are based on Alberta Environment and Parks most recent (2020) inundation maps. There is uncertainty inherent in predicting the effects of flood events, and this uncertainty increases for floods with less than a 1% chance of occurrence in any year. Any use of this data must recognizing the uncertainty with regards to the exact location and extent of flooding.\nMore information on flood mapping for Calgary is available at https://calgary.ca/flood\nFor Calgary's River Flood story, see: https://maps.calgary.ca/RiverFlooding/",

    "description": "The Calgary Equity Index Overlay Statistics are derived from Citizen Satisfaction surveys and census demographics. \r\nThe Calgary Equity Index is a decision-making tool designed to measure equity in Calgary, based on a social determinant of health (SDOH) framework. The SDOH are the range of interacting social and economic conditions that influence people\u2019s health and well-being. This index provides an equity lens to examine the ways in which social and economic conditions are experienced and distributed among populations. It will help the City examine where inequities exist in different areas. Information is available for 113 Community Service Areas (CSAs) across Calgary. The CSAs were created by combining two adjacent Census Tracts to reach a population of around 10,000. The CSAs are numbered from 1 to 113, and are displayed on the map.",

    "description": "In addition to monitoring crime levels, the Calgary Police Service uses a range of types of calls for service (CFS) to monitor levels of \"Disorder.\" Research indicates that disorder can have a negative impact on public perceptions of safety. Disorder is often highly visible, occurring in public spaces; drunks, panhandling, youth gangs, prostitution, littering, loitering and graffiti are examples of signals of social and physical disorder. A very low proportion of disorder-based calls for service result in crime reports.\n\nDisorder CFS included are: Drunk, Disturbance, Indecent Act, Landlord/tenant, Mental health concern, Neighbor dispute, Party complaint, Suspicious person, Threats, Drugs, Noise complaint, Possible gunshots, Unwanted guest/patron, Prostitution, Speeder.\n\nPlease note there has been an update to the methodology for disorder in January of 2024, including the removal of property damage and Abandoned auto, resulting in the dissolution of disorder sub-categories. Disorder counts will therefore not be directly comparable to previously published disorder reporting.  \n\nOnly public-generated call types are included: Advised, Callback, and Dispatched (police-generated calls are excluded). All dispositions are included.\n\nEvents are assigned to communities based on the geocode in CAD. Count is by single event.\n\nData source: Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) run on the 4th of the month (or the closest business day) for the previous month. This data is considered to be static. Property Damage occurrences reported using the online reporting system are included from the CPS records management system (SENTRY). This data is considered to be cumulative.",

    "description": "Using data collected in 2020, The City has created this solar potential dataset of all buildings within city limits. The data shows varying degrees of a roof\u2019s solar exposure, on an annual basis, in generalized optimal conditions. The data model used to generate the map takes into account the shape of the terrain and the relative position of building rooftops and structures, existing infrastructure, and tree canopies. It doesn\u2019t take into account weather conditions, such as cloudy days and precipitation that limit a roof\u2019s direct solar exposure. It also does not reflect any new adjacent structures captured after 2020 that may obstruct another building\u2019s solar exposure.\n\nThe Yield levels are measured as kWh\\m2\\day. Yield values are interpreted as: Low Yield (0 - 0.87); Low Moderate Yield (0.87 - 1.74); High Moderate Yield (1.74 - 2.61); High Yield (2.61 - 3.48)\n\nThe compressed file for download is 362 MB. The uncompressed files are 4.46  GB. Data is arranged in Townships, with 21 GeoTiff image files in total.\n\nThe Solar map data is intended for information purposes only and as a preliminary solar opportunity assessment tool. It is not intended to be used as a decision making source of information for solar panel installations.",

The new draft maps can be viewed here: https://floods.alberta.ca/?app_code=FI&mapType=Draft)\n\nThese inundation maps show whether a property is at risk for various sized river floods. The size of flood shown on this map has a 1/1000 or a 0.1% chance of occurring in any year. \n\nThe three distinct types of inundation shown on the maps are:\no\tInundation - Area flooded overland due to riverbank overtopping.\no\tIsolated - Low lying areas that will not be wet from riverbank overtopping, but may experience groundwater seepage or stormwater backup.\no\tPotential failure of flood protection barrier - Low lying areas that could be flooded if an existing permanent flood protection barrier were to fail.\n\nThe flood areas shown were mapped in 2015 jointly by Alberta Environment and Parks and the City of Calgary, using the best available hydrologic and hydraulic data and models. As such, the flooding shown reflects 2015 conditions, hydrology and topography. The effects of mitigation measures (changes to reservoirs/dams or barriers) built since 2015 are not included. There is uncertainty inherent in predicting the effects of flood events, and this uncertainty increases for floods with less than a 1% chance of occurrence in any year. Any use of this data must recognizing the uncertainty with regards to the exact location and extent of flooding. \n\nMore information on flood mapping for Calgary is available at https://calgary.ca/flood \nFor Calgary's River Flood story, see: https://maps.calgary.ca/RiverFlooding/",

    "description": "A water service pipe, also known as a water service line, is the way drinking water is delivered to each home in Calgary. The water service pipe can be thought of as two sections:<br />(1) From the water main to the property line: This part of the pipe is owned and maintained by The City of Calgary.<br />(2) From the property line to your house: This part of the pipe is owned and maintained by the homeowner. <br />The data shown here only relates to the portion of the water service pipe on public property, owned and operated by The City.  The material on private property can be a different material, and could have been installed at a different time. The data shown on this map is subject to change due to parcel re-development or The City repair/maintenance activities.  If you believe there is an error or an omission regarding to the pipe material provided on this map, please contact 311.<br />For more information, please visit: <a href=\"https://www.calgary.ca/UEP/Water/Pages/Water-and-wastewater-systems/Water-Service-Lines-Calgary.aspx\">Water Service Lines in Calgary</a>",

    "description": "Using data collected in 2018, The City has created this solar potential dataset of all buildings within city limits. The data shows varying degrees of a roof\u2019s solar exposure, on an annual basis, in generalized optimal conditions. The data model used to generate the map takes into account the shape of the terrain and the relative position of building rooftops and structures, existing infrastructure, and tree canopies. It doesn\u2019t take into account weather conditions, such as cloudy days and precipitation that limit a roof\u2019s direct solar exposure. It also does not reflect any new adjacent structures built after 2018 that may obstruct another building\u2019s solar exposure.\n\nThe Yield levels are measured as kWh\\m2\\day. Yield values are interpreted as: Low Yield (0 - 0.87); Low Moderate Yield (0.87 - 1.74); High Moderate Yield (1.74 - 2.61); High Yield (2.61 - 3.48)\n\nThe compressed file for download is 326 MB. The uncompressed files are 3.95 GB. Data is arranged in Townships, with 21 GeoTiff image files in total.\n\nThe Solar map data is intended for information purposes only and as a preliminary solar opportunity assessment tool. It is not intended to be used as a decision making source of information for solar panel installations.",

    "description": "This chart shows weight per cent composition grouped by material category.\r\n\r\nThis dataset is for garbage bin waste from the Industrial, Commercial, and Institutional (ICI) sector. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is used to categorize ICI businesses and organizations into sub-sectors for ease of data collection and reporting.  The NAICS sub-sectors included in this study are: Accommodation and Food Services (NAICS code 72), Retail Trade (44-45), Manufacturing (31-33), Health Care and Social Assistance (62), and Public Administration (91).  All businesses and organizations included in the study were customers of The City\u2019s Commercial Collections service, except for one privately-serviced customer in the Accommodation and Food Services sub-sector that was added to provide better sector representation.  A total of 115 samples are included in the dataset:  30 in Accommodation and Food Services, 35 in Retail Trade, 17 in Manufacturing, 25 in Health Care and Social Assistance, and 8 in Public Administration.  The weight per cent for each sub-sector is the pooled average of samples collected in the four seasons of 2019.  \r\n\r\nWaste Composition studies are periodically conducted by Waste and Recycling Services to help assess the performance of diversion and education programs and inform improvements and new program design.",

All businesses and organizations included in the study were customers of The City\u2019s Commercial Collections service, except for one privately-serviced customer in the Accommodation and Food Services sub-sector that was added to provide better sector representation.  A total of 115 samples are included in the dataset:  30 in Accommodation and Food Services, 35 in Retail Trade, 17 in Manufacturing, 25 in Health Care and Social Assistance, and 8 in Public Administration.  The weight per cent for each sub-sector is the pooled average of samples collected in the four seasons of 2019.

The water service pipe can be thought of as two sections:\n(1) From the water main to the property line: This part of the pipe is owned and maintained by The City of Calgary.\n(2) From the property line to your house: This part of the pipe is owned and maintained by the homeowner. \nThe data shown here only relates to the portion of the water service pipe on public property, owned and operated by The City.  The material on private property can be a different material, and could have been installed at a different time. The data shown on this map is subject to change due to parcel re-development or The City repair/maintenance activities.  If you believe there is an error or an omission regarding to the pipe material provided on this map, please contact 311.\nFor more information, please visit: <a href=\"https://www.calgary.ca/UEP/Water/Pages/Water-and-wastewater-systems/Water-Service-Lines-Calgary.aspx\">Water Service Lines in Calgary</a>",

The data shows varying degrees of a roof\u2019s solar exposure, on an annual basis, in generalized optimal conditions. The data model used to generate the map takes into account the shape of the terrain and the relative position of building rooftops and structures, existing infrastructure, and tree canopies. It doesn\u2019t take into account weather conditions, such as cloudy days and precipitation that limit a roof\u2019s direct solar exposure. It also does not reflect any new adjacent structures built after 2012 that may obstruct another building\u2019s solar exposure. \n\nThe Yield levels are measured as kWh\\m2\\day. Yield values are interpreted as: Low Yield (0 - 0.87); Low Moderate Yield (0.87 - 1.74); High Moderate Yield (1.74 - 2.61); High Yield (2.61 - 3.48)\n\nThe compressed file for download is 4.25 GB. The uncompressed files are 4.5 GB. Data is arranged in Townships, with 18 GeoTiff image files in total.\n\nThe Solar map data is intended for information purposes only and as a preliminary solar opportunity assessment tool. It is not intended to be used as a decision making source of information for solar panel installations.",

The data is collected by the Calgary Region Airshed Zone and submitted to Alberta Environment and Parks (AEP). The data is delivered to the airdata warehouse, a central repository for Alberta's ambient air quality data via a web service provided by AEP. In this way, AEP provides access to quality controlled historical air quality data at its air quality stations.\nIn addition to air quality monitoring data, an Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) is calculated hourly at certain monitoring stations. The AQHI is a simple way to interpret air quality conditions: it provides a number from 1 to 10+ which indicates the relative health risk associated with local air quality. The higher the number, the greater the health risk. Further information on the AQHI calculation is available at: https://www.alberta.ca/air-quality-health-index--calculation.aspx",

The new draft maps can be viewed here: https://floods.alberta.ca/?app_code=FI&mapType=Draft)\nThese inundation maps show whether a property is at risk for various sized river floods. The size of flood shown on this map has a 1/200 or a 0.5% chance of occurring in any year.\nThe three distinct types of inundation shown on the maps are:\no Inundation - Area flooded overland due to riverbank overtopping.\no Isolated - Low lying areas that will not be wet from riverbank overtopping, but may experience groundwater seepage or stormwater backup.\no Protected - Area protected by a permanent flood barrier.\nThe flood areas shown are based on Alberta Environment and Parks most recent (2020) inundation maps. There is uncertainty inherent in predicting the effects of flood events, and this uncertainty increases for floods with less than a 1% chance of occurrence in any year. Any use of this data must recognizing the uncertainty with regards to the exact location and extent of flooding.\nMore information on flood mapping for Calgary is available at https://calgary.ca/flood\nFor Calgary's River Flood story, see: https://maps.calgary.ca/RiverFlooding/",

The new draft maps can be viewed here: https://floods.alberta.ca/?app_code=FI&mapType=Draft)\nThese inundation maps show whether a property is at risk for various sized river floods. The size of flood shown on this map has a 1/100 or a 1% chance of occurring in any year.\nThe three distinct types of inundation shown on the maps are:\no Inundation - Area flooded overland due to riverbank overtopping.\no Isolated - Low lying areas that will not be wet from riverbank overtopping, but may experience groundwater seepage or stormwater backup.\no Protected - Area protected by a permanent flood barrier.\nThe flood areas shown are based on Alberta Environment and Parks most recent (2020) inundation maps. There is uncertainty inherent in predicting the effects of flood events, and this uncertainty increases for floods with less than a 1% chance of occurrence in any year. Any use of this data must recognizing the uncertainty with regards to the exact location and extent of flooding.\nMore information on flood mapping for Calgary is available at https://calgary.ca/flood\nFor Calgary's River Flood story, see: https://maps.calgary.ca/RiverFlooding/",

    "description": "(Note: Updated inundation maps for 1:2 to 1:1000 floods are available from Alberta Environment and Parks (2020). The new draft maps can be viewed here: https://floods.alberta.ca/?app_code=FI&mapType=Draft)\nThese inundation maps show whether a property is at risk for various sized river floods. The size of flood shown on this map has a 1/5 or a 20% chance of occurring in any year.\nThe three distinct types of inundation shown on the maps are:\no Inundation - Area flooded overland due to riverbank overtopping.\no Isolated - Low lying areas that will not be wet from riverbank overtopping, but may experience groundwater seepage or stormwater backup.\no Protected - Area protected by a permanent flood barrier.\nThe flood areas shown are based on Alberta Environment and Parks most recent (2020) inundation maps. There is uncertainty inherent in predicting the effects of flood events, and this uncertainty increases for floods with less than a 1% chance of occurrence in any year. Any use of this data must recognizing the uncertainty with regards to the exact location and extent of flooding.\nMore information on flood mapping for Calgary is available at https://calgary.ca/flood\nFor Calgary's River Flood story, see: https://maps.calgary.ca/RiverFlooding/",

Missing and/or overlapping areas were resolved manually and City parks were reviewed at 1:1000 resolution.

The data is collected by the Calgary Region Airshed Zone and submitted to Alberta Environment and Parks (AEP). The data is delivered to the airdata warehouse, a central repository for Alberta's ambient air quality data via a web service provided by AEP. In this way, AEP provides access to quality controlled historical air quality data at its air quality stations.\nIn addition to air quality monitoring data, an Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) is calculated hourly at certain monitoring stations. The AQHI is a simple way to interpret air quality conditions: it provides a number from 1 to 10+ which indicates the relative health risk associated with local air quality. The higher the number, the greater the health risk. Further information on the AQHI calculation is available at: https://www.alberta.ca/air-quality-health-index--calculation.aspx",

    "description": "Every year in May, The City conducts the Central Business District (CBD) cordon count. The cordon count is performed at 31 locations around the CBD over a three week time period, collecting data on how people travel into and out of downtown Calgary. The CBD cordon circles the downtown with the Bow River to the north and the railway tracks to the south and from 11 Street in the west to the Elbow River in the east. These data represent the total number of persons entering (inbound) and exiting (outbound) at each location, by modes, during a 16 hour time period. This raw dataset is NOT normalized to average weekday. It is a snapshot of the inbound and outbound activity on a single day at these locations and reflects conditions specific to that day such as construction, lane closures, weather, etc. Therefore, data may not be directly comparable between locations or years. \n*Attachment is a summary of the inbound and outbound totals and mode of travel.* For additional information on cordon counts, see About --> Source URL.",

The data shows varying degrees of a roof\u2019s solar exposure, on an annual basis, in generalized optimal conditions. The data model used to generate the map takes into account the shape of the terrain and the relative position of building rooftops and structures, existing infrastructure, and tree canopies. It doesn\u2019t take into account weather conditions, such as cloudy days and precipitation that limit a roof\u2019s direct solar exposure. It also does not reflect any new adjacent structures built after 2012 that may obstruct another building\u2019s solar exposure.  \r\n\r\nThe Yield levels are measured as kWh\\m2\\day.  Yield values are interpreted as:  Low Yield (0 - 0.87); Low Moderate Yield (0.87 - 1.74); High Moderate Yield (1.74 - 2.61); High Yield (2.61 - 3.48)\r\n\r\nThe compressed file for download is 3 GB.  The uncompressed files are 3.35 GB.  Data is arranged in Townships, with 16 GeoTiff image files in total.\r\n\r\nThe Solar map data is intended for information purposes only and as a preliminary solar opportunity assessment tool.  It is not intended to be used as a decision making source of information for solar panel installations.",

    "description": "Every year in May, The City conducts the Central Business District (CBD) cordon count. The cordon count is performed at 31 locations around the CBD over a three week time period, collecting data on how people travel into and out of downtown Calgary. The CBD cordon circles the downtown with the Bow River to the north and the railway tracks to the south and from 11 Street in the west to the Elbow River in the east. These data represent the total number of persons entering (inbound) and exiting (outbound) at each location, by modes, during a 16 hour time period. This raw dataset is NOT normalized to average weekday. It is a snapshot of the inbound and outbound activity on a single day at these locations and reflects conditions specific to that day such as construction, lane closures, weather, etc. Therefore, data may not be directly comparable between locations or years. \n*Attachment is a summary of the inbound and outbound totals and mode of travel.* For additional information on cordon counts, see <a href=\"http://www.calgary.ca/Transportation/TP/Pages/Planning/Transportation-Data/Central-Business-District-Cordon-Count.aspx\">Central Business District Cordon Count</a>.",
