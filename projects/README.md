# Projects

Active, time-bound work with clear done-states. Each file = one project.

## Format

```markdown
# Project Name
**Status:** Active | Paused | Done
**Started:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Goal:** One sentence — what does "done" look like?

## Context
Why this exists, background info.

## Current State
Where things are right now.

## Next Steps
- [ ] Concrete next action
- [ ] Another action

## Log
- YYYY-MM-DD: What happened
```

## Rules
- When a project finishes → move file to `projects/archive/`
- Keep files small — link to memory/ or brain/ for deep context
- Review at session start to know what's in flight
